    In a credit card fraud detection system, develop a function that takes a transaction description or merchant name and returns a character-sorted version. The sorting helps reveal potential text manipulation patterns that might indicate fraudulent activity. The function should preserve the original word order and spacing while rearranging the characters of each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values. This transformation can help analysts identify suspicious transaction descriptions that might be deliberately obfuscated or altered to hide their true nature.

    In a medical risk assessment system, healthcare professionals need a precise method to round clinical measurements for accurate patient evaluation. Develop a function that takes a patient's clinical measurement as a string and returns the closest integer value, with special handling for borderline cases. When a measurement is exactly halfway between two integers, the function must round away from zero to ensure the most conservative risk interpretation. For example, a body temperature reading of ""37.5"" should round to 38, while ""-37.5"" would round to -38. This rounding approach helps clinicians make more informed decisions about potential health risks and intervention strategies. The function must handle both positive and negative measurements with consistent rounding logic. The system will use this function to standardize clinical data for risk assessment algorithms and medical record documentation.
